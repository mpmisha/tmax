## Features

**Multiple Terminals in One View**
- Tiling layout with horizontal/vertical splits (binary tree, like tmux)
- Floating panels that can be dragged, resized, and maximized; floating panes show a `[FLOAT]` pill in the title bar
- Float / restore button in every pane title bar (or `Ctrl+Shift+U`)
- Equalize all panes to the same size with one shortcut
- Status indicators per pane (green = active, grey = idle, red = error)
- Focused pane highlighted with green-tinted title bar
- Status bar terminal count is clickable - opens a popover listing every terminal with its title, mode, and AI session status; click a row to focus it
- Floating "jump to bottom" button appears when you scroll up in any pane; click to snap back to the live tail

**Workspaces**
- A tab is a workspace - each one keeps its own panes, layout, and color tint
- Drag workspace tabs to reorder; the order persists across restarts
- Switch workspaces from the workspace tab bar; per-workspace state is saved across restarts
- Multi-select panes (Ctrl+click / Cmd+click on a pane title bar) to act on several at once - "Show Selected (N)" toolbar button plus Command Palette entries (Show Selected Panes / Show All Panes / Clear Pane Selection)
- Move a pane to another workspace from the pane ⋯ menu or the Command Palette - PTY, cwd, and scrollback survive the move
- Per-workspace color tint with a colorize toggle that paints the workspace tab and its pane title bars
- Focus-mode pane indicator: a row of dots at the bottom of the focused pane shows the pane count and lets you click to switch (Ctrl+Tab still works for power users)

**Grid View Mode**
- Toggle between Focus (single terminal) and Grid layout (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)
- Grid auto-arranges terminals: 2x2, 3x2, etc. based on terminal count
- Cycle grid column count with `Ctrl+Shift+L` (1-col stack, 2-col, 3-col, ...)
- Fully resizable dividers in grid mode

**Tab Groups**
- Group related tabs with shared colors and collapsible headers
- Right-click tab > Add to Group (supports multi-select with Ctrl+click)
- Group header right-click: Rename, Color picker, Ungroup All, Close All
- Drag tabs between groups to reorganize
- Group color tints both tabs and terminal pane backgrounds

**AI Sessions Panel**
- Monitor GitHub Copilot and Claude Code sessions in real-time (`Ctrl+Shift+C`)
- Shows session status, summary, branch, repo, message/tool counts, and relative time
- Click a session to resume it directly in a new terminal pane
- Jump to any previous prompt in the terminal (`Ctrl+Shift+K`)
- Cross-session prompt search (`Ctrl+Shift+Y`) - search every prompt across every AI session, with `foo AND bar` syntax to require multiple terms. Results stream in progressively, with a jump glyph (↗ for live panes, ↑ for inactive sessions) on each row. Inactive sessions resume in a new pane on click
- Filter tabs: All / Copilot / Claude Code; sidebar search by name, branch, cwd, or summary (also supports the AND syntax)
- AI session shimmer: a soft border pulse on any pane whose AI session is waiting for your input, suppressed when you focus the pane. Useful peripheral cue on a multi-monitor setup. Toggle in Settings → Terminal
- Native AI session notifications when Claude Code or Copilot CLI finishes a turn or asks for approval, with a Settings → Notifications exclude list to silence specific titles or bodies
- Per-group `+` button on each repo group header spawns a fresh Copilot session in that group's folder - faster than typing the resume command yourself
- Wake / ping button per session row - writes a no-op so a dormant session refreshes its status
- SQLite-backed Copilot session loading - reads Copilot CLI's local store directly for ~150ms startup on busy machines
- Bulk Cleanup sessions - archive everything below a prompt-count threshold (pinned and already-archived sessions are skipped)
- WSL session discovery — sessions from WSL distros appear with a distro badge

**File Explorer**
- Sidebar file tree for the focused terminal's CWD (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
- Breadcrumb path navigation — click any segment to jump, or type a path directly
- Navigate up, home (terminal CWD), or double-click folders to enter
- File type icons (TS, JS, JSON, CSS, HTML, MD, PY, and more)
- Single click to preview file content in a resizable side panel
- Double click to open in default editor
- Right-click menu: Preview, Open in Editor, Browse Here, CD Here, Copy Path
- Filter input (supports `foo AND bar` for multi-token matches), show/hide dotfiles toggle, collapse all button
- WSL filesystem support

**Diff Review**
- Built-in diff review overlay for code changes
- File tree with filter search
- Inline code review with annotations

**Click-to-Preview**
- Click any `.md` path in terminal output to open an in-app markdown preview - rendered headings, mermaid diagrams, zoom, drag-to-resize, and a Friendly/Raw toggle
- Click any image path (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.webp`) to open an in-app image viewer with zoom and drag-to-resize. Works for absolute, relative, and bare-basename paths (Copilot CLI's `[basename.png]` shape resolves too)
- Both previews have an "Open externally" button if you'd rather route to the OS default viewer

**Keyboard-Driven Workflow**
- Command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) with every action searchable (supports `foo AND bar` token filtering)
- Jump to any terminal by name (`Ctrl+Shift+G`) - also supports the AND syntax
- Pane hints for quick terminal switching (`Ctrl+Shift+J`)
- Rename the focused pane in place with `Ctrl+Shift+R`
- Refresh / restart the focused pane in place with `Ctrl+Alt+R` - tears down and respawns the PTY, preserving title and cwd
- `Ctrl+Insert` copies the current selection - third alias alongside `Ctrl+Shift+C` and the right-click menu
- Undo close pane / workspace (`Ctrl+Shift+T`) - 10-deep stack that restores cwd, title, color, and resumes the AI session if it's still in the live list. Confirms before restoring so an accidental keypress doesn't spawn PTYs unexpectedly
- Split, move, resize, and navigate — all from the keyboard
- Every shortcut is fully configurable
- macOS support: all Ctrl shortcuts work with Cmd, UI shows native symbols (⌘/⌥)

**Modern Tab Bar**
- Rounded pill-style tabs with subtle borders
- Hide/show tab bar (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) for maximum screen space
- Tab colors shown as bottom line indicator
- Drag & drop to reorder or split

**Appearance**
- Font picker with all installed monospace fonts
- Windows 11 Mica/Acrylic transparency (Appearance tab in Settings)
- Background material and opacity controls
- 12 built-in theme presets (8 dark, 4 light) - Catppuccin Mocha/Latte, Warm Dusk, Tokyo Night, Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox Dark, Rosé Pine / Dawn, Solarized Dark/Light, GitHub Light - or hand-pick every color. Switching a preset recolors the whole app, not just the terminal area
- Dark title bar forced regardless of system theme

**Drag & Drop**
- Drag tabs to split panes (left/right/top/bottom indicators)
- Drag to swap terminal positions
- Drag to detach as floating panel
- Visual drop zone labels showing exactly where the terminal will land
- Drop a file (or multiple files) from File Explorer onto a terminal pane to write the path(s) into the prompt

**Session Management**
- Auto-save/restore on close, crash, or reboot (saves every 5 seconds)
- Named layouts: save and load terminal arrangements with titles and working directories
- Startup commands per terminal — restored when loading a layout

**WSL Integration**
- Discover AI sessions running inside WSL distros
- Sessions appear with distro badge in the AI Sessions panel
- Resume WSL sessions in the correct distro and working directory
- File explorer works with WSL filesystems
- Terminal CWD tracking translates WSL paths for the Dirs panel

**Configurable Everything**
- Settings UI (`Ctrl+,`) with tabs for Terminal, Keybindings, Shells, Theme, and Appearance
- Re-record any keybinding by clicking it
- Add/remove shell profiles (PowerShell, CMD, WSL, or any executable)
- Set default start folder globally or per shell

- Close / Close Others / Close All

## Download

Download the latest version from the [Releases page](https://github.com/InbarR/tmax/releases). Available for Windows (.exe installer + portable .zip), macOS (.dmg for Apple Silicon and Intel), and Linux (.deb, .rpm).

### Troubleshooting Downloads

tmax is an independent open-source project and isn't code-signed (certificates cost $300-600/year on Windows and $99/year on macOS). Your browser and operating system may warn you about the download. All of these warnings are cosmetic - nothing is wrong with the file itself. Here's how to get past each one.

---

#### 🪟 Windows

**"isn't commonly downloaded" (Edge / Chrome)**

![Edge SmartScreen warning](docs/screenshots/download-warn-edge.png)

Your browser may silently pause the download and show the message above, or quietly stash it as `Unconfirmed *.crdownload` in your Downloads folder:

![Unconfirmed crdownload](docs/screenshots/download-warn-crdownload.png)

This is [Microsoft SmartScreen's reputation filter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/virus-and-threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/) - new / niche installers trigger it regardless of content.

To allow the download:
1. In the download warning, click the **⋯** menu and choose **Keep**. Edge then shows a second dialog:

   ![Edge Keep confirmation](docs/screenshots/download-warn-edge-expanded.png)

2. Click the **dropdown arrow** next to the red **Delete** button and choose **Keep anyway**.

**"Windows protected your PC" on first launch**

After installing, the first time you run tmax you'll see a blue "Windows protected your PC" dialog from SmartScreen. Click **More info** at the top, then **Run anyway** at the bottom.

---

#### 🍎 macOS

**"tmax is damaged and can't be opened"**

![macOS damaged warning](docs/screenshots/download-warn-macos.png)

Despite what the dialog says, the app is fine. macOS requires apps to be signed with an Apple Developer certificate ($99/year). Since I'm not planning to pay that evil company 😏, you have to bypass the quarantine flag yourself. Click **Cancel** (not Move to Trash!) and run this in Terminal:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/tmax.app
```

This clears the quarantine extended attribute so macOS skips the signature check. Open tmax normally afterwards.

If you installed to a different location, adjust the path (e.g. `~/Applications/tmax.app`).

- **Linux**: `build-essential`, `python3`, `libx11-dev`, `libxkbfile-dev`

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InbarR/tmax.git
cd tmax
npm install
npm start
```

### Build Installer

```bash
npm run build

```

**Key design decisions:**
- Binary tree layout engine for tmux-style tiling with arbitrary splits
- Zustand for state management (terminals, layout, focus, config)
- `@dnd-kit` for structured drag & drop with per-pane drop zones
- `node-pty` with ConPTY for native Windows terminal emulation
- `contextIsolation: true` for Electron security
- Session auto-save every 5s for crash recovery
- Renderer heartbeat for freeze detection diagnostics

## Configuration

Settings are stored at:
```
%APPDATA%/tmax/tmax-config.json
```

You can edit this file directly or use the Settings UI (`Ctrl+,`).

### AI Session Commands

The commands used to resume Copilot and Claude Code sessions are configurable in **Settings > Terminal**:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Copilot Command | `copilot` | Base command for Copilot sessions |
| Claude Code Command | `claude` | Base command for Claude Code sessions |

This lets you use custom aliases or wrapper scripts. The configured command is invoked as `<command> --resume <sessionId>`.

## Support & Known Issues

### Double-clicking a word in Copilot CLI / Claude Code, then right-clicking, doesn't copy

In **Copilot CLI** (and sometimes **Claude Code**), if you double-click a word to select it and then right-click, tmax pastes whatever was previously on your clipboard instead of copying the highlighted word.

This happens because those tools take over the mouse to power their own UI, so when you double-click, tmax never actually sees a selection to copy from - even though the word looks highlighted on screen.

**What works instead:**
- **Drag across the text** with the left mouse button (instead of double-clicking), then right-click. This works correctly.
- **Press `Ctrl+Shift+C`** to copy when you've already made a selection.
- **Hold `Shift`** while you click or drag - this forces a normal text selection that tmax can copy.

Triple-click line selection has the same limitation. Plain drag-select copy works everywhere.

### Terminal stops accepting keyboard input after switching windows / workspaces

Occasionally after switching apps (Alt+Tab) or workspaces, the focused tmax pane stops registering keystrokes - typing has no effect, and the cursor sometimes appears as a small hollow square pinned to a corner of the pane. This is a DOM-focus issue: another element in the page has stolen keyboard focus from xterm's hidden textarea.

**Reliable fix:** press `Ctrl+Shift+F` twice - that toggles into focus mode and back to grid view, which re-mounts the terminal layout and restores keyboard focus. (Clicking inside the pane content sometimes works, but the focus-toggle is the consistent recovery.)

The original report ([#70](https://github.com/InbarR/tmax/issues/70)) was fixed in v1.6.0; tracking re-occurrence in [#97](https://github.com/InbarR/tmax/issues/97).
