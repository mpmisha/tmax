## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Reported by a new macOS user post-1.10.0. When a session is opened as a floating pane, scrolling stops working and never recovers, even after switching back to grid view. Page Up/Page Down are the only workaround. Likely the float->tile remount leaves mouse-tracking or the scroll model stuck.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Floating then re-tiling a pane leaves wheel scrolling working
- [ ] #2 Repro covered by a Playwright test
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The TASK-158 portal change (panes no longer remount on tiling reshape) very likely fixes this - float->re-tile no longer recreates xterm. Needs verification: float a pane, return to grid, confirm wheel scroll works. NOTE: scroll-after-DETACH is a separate issue (alt-buffer/mouse-tracking, see the new detach-scroll task).

Detach was removed (TASK-166, commit 0bd8113), but FLOAT remains. If float-scroll is still broken: same family - floated mouse-tracking pane drops the wheel report. A drafted fix (tmax emits the wheel report itself via coreMouseService.triggerMouseEvent with freshly-computed coords; CoreMouseButton.WHEEL=4, action UP=0/DOWN=1, x/y required) was verified to emit valid SGR reports in e2e but reverted to keep the detach-removal change focused. Revisit here if float-scroll needs fixing.
