## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
TASK-151 fixed the loadSession first-prompt fallback (drops the `workspace.name === id` guard) but only added e2e coverage for the ClawPilot cwd fingerprint. The loadSession code path needs its own test: workspace.yaml without a `summary:` field + events.jsonl with at least one user.message → summary should be the first prompt.

This is heavier than the existing notification-only specs because it needs to drive the real CopilotSessionMonitor against a fixture sessions directory. Suggestion: factor a helper that writes a temp session directory and points a monitor instance at it, asserts toSummary().summary.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Test fixture writes workspace.yaml (no summary) + events.jsonl (1 user.message)
- [x] #2 Test instantiates CopilotSessionMonitor on the fixture, calls scanSessions(), asserts session.summary === the first prompt
- [x] #3 Test also covers the case where workspace.yaml has both a repository and no summary - summary still wins via the fallback
<!-- AC:END -->

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Added e2e coverage for the TASK-151 first-prompt fallback in CopilotSessionMonitor.loadSession.

Changes:
- src/main/main.ts: new TMAX_E2E global hook __scanCopilotSessionsAtPath(basePath) that instantiates a fresh CopilotSessionMonitor against a fixture directory and returns the scanned summaries. Mirrors the existing __notifyCopilotSession / __setNotificationExcludeStrings pattern.
- tests/e2e/task-153-loadsession-first-prompt-fallback.spec.ts (new): three cases:
  1. workspace.yaml without summary + events.jsonl with one user message -> summary becomes that prompt.
  2. workspace.yaml with repository AND no summary (the exact pre-TASK-151 bug shape) -> first prompt still wins, repo name doesn't leak into the summary.
  3. Inverse: workspace.yaml with an explicit summary -> fallback does NOT run, explicit summary preserved.

Fixture helper writes a temp directory under os.tmpdir() and cleans it up in the finally block. Hook only registers under TMAX_E2E=1 so production runs aren't affected.
