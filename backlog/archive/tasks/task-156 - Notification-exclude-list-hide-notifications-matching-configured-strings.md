## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
ClawPilot and similar AI agents fire OS notifications for background automations (e.g. "ClawPilot - Waiting for Input" with a body referring to a scheduled automation completing). The user wants to suppress these without disabling notifications globally. Add a configurable substring deny-list so any notification whose title or body contains a configured string (case-insensitive) is silently dropped before reaching the OS toast layer.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 User can edit a list of exclude strings in Settings > Notifications
- [x] #2 Matching is case-insensitive substring; a notification is suppressed if ANY rule matches the title OR the body
- [x] #3 Exclude list persists in tmax-config.json across restarts
- [x] #4 Suppressed notifications are not shown as OS toasts and do not play sound
- [x] #5 Empty / whitespace-only rules are ignored (do not match everything)
- [x] #6 Adding/removing/editing entries takes effect immediately without restart
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Implementation complete:
- Config: notificationExcludeStrings: string[] added to AppConfig (default [])
- Filter: isExcluded() in copilot-notification.ts; case-insensitive substring against title OR body; empty/whitespace entries ignored
- Wire-up: setNotificationExcludeStrings called on boot in setupConfigStore and on every CONFIG_UPDATE for the same key
- Filter runs before E2E capture and before notification.show, so suppressed turns are silent and untrackable
- Filter does NOT apply to update-checker notifications (scoped to AI session noise only)
- Settings UI: textarea under AI sessions group, one phrase per line; .notification-exclude-textarea CSS in global.css
- E2E spec at tests/e2e/task-156-notification-exclude.spec.ts (6 cases: body match, case-insensitive, non-match still fires, blank rules ignored, title match for ClawPilot, clearing list re-enables)
- New __setNotificationExcludeStrings test hook exposed under TMAX_E2E=1

Typecheck: no new errors in touched files (pre-existing TerminalPanel / terminal-store errors unrelated).
Pending: run the new spec; awaiting user OK to run e2e.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Notification exclude list shipped. Users can configure case-insensitive substring rules in Settings > Notifications; matching notifications are dropped before reaching the OS toast layer. Rules persist in tmax-config.json and take effect immediately without restart. Whitespace-only rules are ignored.
