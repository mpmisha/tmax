## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
In workspaces mode, focus mode hides the tab/pane chrome to give the focused pane the full screen. That removes the visible affordance for switching between panes - the only way to navigate is the Ctrl+Tab keyboard shortcut, which the user has to already know about. New users (or users coming from non-workspaces flow) get stuck in focus mode with no UI hint that switching is even possible. Want a discoverable alternative. Options: (1) edge hover - mouse to a screen edge reveals a thin tab strip that auto-hides; (2) always-visible thin indicator (mini tab bar / dots) showing pane count and current position; (3) onboarding tooltip the first time the user enters focus mode in workspaces; (4) Esc-or-similar to bring tabs back temporarily; (5) ensure Ctrl+Tab is in the keybindings.json default set so it shows up in any 'shortcuts' surface.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 From a fresh state, a new user can discover how to switch panes in focus mode without reading docs
- [x] #2 There is a visible affordance (or auto-revealing one) for pane switching that does not break the full-screen focus aesthetic
- [x] #3 Existing Ctrl+Tab behavior is preserved - power users keep their flow
- [x] #4 Affordance does not appear when there is only one pane in the workspace

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. In TilingLayout, walk the tilingRoot to collect leaf terminal IDs.\n2. Render a small floating indicator (row of dots) top-center when viewMode === 'focus' and 2+ panes.\n3. Each dot is a clickable button that calls setFocus.\n4. Subtle styling: 55% opacity at rest, 100% on hover; active pane dot is wider/highlighted; tooltip shows pane title.\n5. Hidden when only 1 pane (no point) or not in focus mode.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
2026-05-03: Shipped a top-center dot indicator. Each pane gets a dot, focused pane is wider+blue. Hover any dot for tooltip with pane title; click to switch. Hidden when 1 pane or not in focus mode. Tackles AC #2 (visible affordance), #3 (Ctrl+Tab still works), #4 (no clutter when only 1 pane). AC #1 (new user discovers without docs) is partially - dots are visible but tiny; if feedback wants something louder we can add a first-time tooltip later.

## Final Summary

<!-- SECTION:FINAL_SUMMARY:BEGIN -->
Shipped in commit fb3bfe5. TilingLayout now renders a FocusModePaneIndicator (floating row of small dots top-center) when viewMode === 'focus' and 2+ panes exist. Each dot represents a pane in tiling order; focused pane's dot is wider and highlighted; hover shows pane title; click sets focus. Subtle styling (55% opacity at rest, 100% on hover) so it stays out of the way. Hidden when 1 pane or in normal mode. Existing Ctrl+Tab keyboard flow unchanged.
